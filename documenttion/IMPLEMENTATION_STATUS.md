## ⏳ Manual Implementation Required

### **Profile Page Tab Contents**
**File:** `client/src/pages/dashboard/Profile.jsx`  
**Status:** Code provided in `PROFILE_TABS_CODE.md`

**What's Missing:**
The Profile page currently only implements the "Overview" tab. Five additional tabs need to be added:

1. **About Tab** - Personal information with edit mode
2. **Skills Tab** - Skills management with progress bars
3. **Activity Tab** - Recent activity timeline
4. **Connections Tab** - Professional network
5. **Settings Tab** - Profile-specific preferences

**Why Manual Implementation Needed:**
After 3 failed automated edit attempts due to whitespace matching issues, the system banned further automated edits to prevent errors.

**Implementation Guide:**
See `PROFILE_TABS_CODE.md` for:
- Complete, ready-to-paste code
- Exact insertion location (after line 1109)
- Step-by-step instructions
- Verification checklist

**Estimated Time:** 10-15 minutes  
**Difficulty:** Easy (copy-paste operation)
