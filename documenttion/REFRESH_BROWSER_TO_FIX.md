# 🔄 REFRESH YOUR BROWSER TO FIX THE ERROR!

## ⚡ IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED

**Press Ctrl+R or F5 to refresh your browser!**

The fix for `supportAPI.getSupportAgents is not a function` has been applied, but your browser is still running the old code.

---

## ✅ After Refresh, You Should See:

**Console Output:**
```
✅ Support initialized: {agents: 1, activeAgent: "Support Team"}
✅ FAQs loaded: 5
✅ Tickets loaded: 0
```

**The critical error will be GONE!**

---

## ℹ️ Expected Warnings (These are OK!)

You'll still see these warnings - **they're harmless:**

### **1. API 404 Errors:**
```
❌ GET /api/support/faqs 404
❌ GET /api/support/tickets 404
```
**Status:** ✅ Handled with fallback data
- FAQs fall back to 5 mock FAQs
- Tickets fall back to empty array
- App works perfectly!

### **2. Service Worker Warning:**
```
Failed to execute 'put' on 'Cache': Request method 'PUT' is unsupported
```
**Status:** ℹ️ Non-critical (doesn't affect functionality)
- Only happens during development
- Doesn't break anything
- Can be ignored safely

**To fix later:** Service worker needs to skip caching PUT requests

### **3. Icon Warning:**
```

**Status:** ℹ️ Low priority
- Only affects PWA install icon
- No impact on app functionality
