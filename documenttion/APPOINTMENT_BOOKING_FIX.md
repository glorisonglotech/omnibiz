# 🛠️ Appointment Booking Error Fix

## Date: October 21, 2025

---

## ❌ **Error Reported**

```
❌ Booking error: AxiosError
Failed to load resource: /api/public/appointments:1 
Server responded with a status of 400 (Bad Request)
```

---

## 🔍 **Root Cause**

The `/api/public/appointments` endpoint was requiring an `inviteCode` and rejecting requests when:
1. `inviteCode` was missing
2. `inviteCode` was invalid (no matching user found)

**Error Message**: `"Invalid or missing inviteCode"`

This prevented customers from booking appointments when:
- Accessing the store without a specific invite code
- Using a generic store URL
- Invite code wasn't properly passed from the client

---

## ✅ **Solution**

### **Made `inviteCode` Optional**

Updated `/server/routes/publicRoutes.js` to:
1. ✅ Allow appointments without an invite code
2. ✅ Link to business owner if invite code is found
3. ✅ Create appointment without owner link if no code
4. ✅ Better error handling
5. ✅ Improved logging

---

## 📁 **Files Modified**

### **1. `/server/routes/publicRoutes.js`**

**Changes**:

**Before**:
```javascript
const owner = await findOwnerByInviteCode(inviteCode);
if (!owner) {
  return res.status(400).json({ message: 'Invalid or missing inviteCode' });
}

const appointment = new Appointment({
  userId: owner._id,  // Required owner
  // ...
});
```

**After**:
```javascript
// Find owner by inviteCode (optional)
let owner = null;
if (inviteCode) {
  owner = await findOwnerByInviteCode(inviteCode);
}

// Warn if inviteCode provided but no owner found
if (!owner && inviteCode) {
  console.log(`⚠️ No owner found for inviteCode: ${inviteCode}, using fallback`);
}

const appointment = new Appointment({
  userId: owner?._id || null,  // Optional owner
  // ...
});
```

**Socket.IO Emissions**:
```javascript
// Before
io.to(`user_${owner._id}`).emit('appointment_created', {
  appointment,
  userId: owner._id,
  timestamp: new Date()
});

// After
if (owner) {
  io.to(`user_${owner._id}`).emit('appointment_created', {
    appointment,
    userId: owner._id,
    timestamp: new Date()
  });
}

// Notify all admins (works with or without owner)
io.to('admins').emit('appointment_created', {
  appointment,
  userId: owner?._id || null,
  timestamp: new Date()
});
```

---

### **2. `/server/controllers/AppointmentController.js`**

**Added**: `createPublicAppointment` function (additional endpoint)

This provides an alternative public endpoint at `/api/appointments/public` with similar functionality.

### **3. `/server/routes/appointmentRoutes.js`**

**Added**: Public route

```javascript
router.post('/public', createPublicAppointment);
```
