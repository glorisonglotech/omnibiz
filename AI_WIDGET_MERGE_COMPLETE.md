## 🎓 Technical Details

### State Management
- Uses React hooks (useState, useRef, useEffect)
- Efficient re-renders with proper dependencies
- localStorage for persistence

### API Integration
- Calls `/api/ai/chat` with full context
- Passes conversation history (last 10 messages)
- Custom system prompt per request
- Graceful error handling

### Learning Algorithm
```javascript
// Stores queries with context
{
  query: "show sales",
  context: { page: "dashboard", userRole: "admin" },
  timestamp: "2025-10-17T..."
}

// Tracks frequency
{
  "show sales": 5,
  "top products": 3,
  "inventory alerts": 2
}
```

### Context Gathering
```javascript
// Fetches real-time data
- Current page from URL
- User info from auth context
- Orders count from API
- Products count from API
- Recent actions from localStorage
```

---

## 🐛 Known Issues & Limitations

### MongoDB Required
- Context gathering requires MongoDB to be running
- Falls back gracefully if MongoDB is down
- Shows context from localStorage if API fails

### localStorage Limits
- Max 50 conversations stored
- Max 100 learning interactions
- Older data auto-deleted

### Backend Dependency
- Requires `/api/ai/chat` endpoint
- Falls back to rule-based responses if backend fails
- Always provides response (never errors)

## 📞 MongoDB Setup Reminder

2. Update `.env` with connection string
3. Restart server
4. Context awareness will work fully ✅

**Current Status**:
- Widget loads: ✅
- Basic chat works: ✅
- Context gathering: ⚠️ (needs MongoDB)
