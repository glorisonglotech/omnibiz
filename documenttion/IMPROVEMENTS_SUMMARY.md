## üìù Implementation Guide

### For Profile.jsx Tab Contents

Since automated editing failed, here's a manual implementation guide:

1. **Open** `client/src/pages/dashboard/Profile.jsx`
2. **Find** line 1109 (the closing `</TabsContent>` tag for Overview)
3. **Insert** the tab contents (see detailed code in PROFILE_TABS_CODE.md)
4. **Save** and test each tab

### For Payment Integration

```javascript
// In Checkout.jsx, add:
import PaymentOptions from '@/components/payments/PaymentOptions';

// In the component:
<PaymentOptions
  amount={totalAmount}
  description="Order payment"
  currency="KES"
  onSuccess={handlePaymentSuccess}
  onError={handlePaymentError}
  showMpesa={true}
  showPaypal={true}
/>
```
