## 📝 **Notes**

### **Supplier Emails**:
Sample supplier emails in Purchasing component were left as-is since they are demo/placeholder data:
- `info@abcsuppliers.com` (demo supplier)
- `sales@xyztrading.com` (demo supplier)
- `orders@techsolutions.com` (demo supplier)

These are intentionally different as they represent third-party suppliers, not OmniBiz contact information.
