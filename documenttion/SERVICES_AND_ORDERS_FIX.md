# 🛠️ Services Database & Order History Fix

## Date: October 21, 2025

---

## ✅ **Issues Fixed**

### **1. Sample Services Not in Database** ✅
**Problem**: 15 sample services were only showing on the client storefront but not saved to the database.

**Solution**: Created a Services management dashboard with a "Load Sample Services" button.

### **2. Order History Not Showing** ✅
**Problem**: Order history not displaying correctly in client storefront.

**Solution**: Fixed currency display to use KES instead of $.
