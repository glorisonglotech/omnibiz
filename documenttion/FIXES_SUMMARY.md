## ‚úÖ Issues Fixed

### 1. **Client Storefront Theme Independence** ‚úÖ FIXED
**Issue**: Client storefront theme was depending on main dashboard theme settings

**Root Cause**: 
- ThemeProvider in App.jsx applies theme globally to entire application
- Storefront theme changes were being overridden by global theme

**Solution**:
- Enhanced storefront theme isolation in `ClientStorefront.jsx`
- Added direct background color and foreground color application to storefront container
- Set `minHeight: 100vh` to ensure full coverage
- Storefront now uses separate localStorage key: `storefront-theme` (vs `theme` for dashboard)

**Files Changed**:
- `client/src/pages/client/ClientStorefront.jsx`

**Commit**: `87d0ce1` - fix: Make storefront theme independent and add video/audio call functionality

---

### 2. **Video/Audio Call Functionality** ‚úÖ FIXED
**Issue**: Video and audio call buttons were not working in chat system

**Root Cause**:
- `CallDialog` component was imported but never rendered in `LiveChatWidget.jsx`
- No handlers existed to open the call dialog
- Call buttons were missing from the UI

**Solution**:
- Added Video and Audio call buttons to LiveChatWidget header
- Implemented click handlers to set call type and open dialog
- Rendered `CallDialog` component with proper props
- Supports both authenticated users and guests
- Uses existing WebRTC infrastructure

**Files Changed**:
- `client/src/components/storefront/LiveChatWidget.jsx`

**Features Added**:
- Video call button with camera icon

**Commit**: `87d0ce1` - fix: Make storefront theme independent and add video/audio call functionality

### 3. **Wishlist Database Persistence** ‚úÖ FIXED
**Issue**: Client storefront wishlist was not updating to database

**Root Cause**:

- No backend model or controller for wishlist

**Solution**:
- Created complete wishlist system with database persistence
- Built Wishlist model supporting users, customers, and guests

**Files Created**:

- `server/routes/wishlistRoutes.js` - API routes

**Files Modified**:

**Commit**: `775dd90` - feat: Implement complete wishlist system with database persistence

### 4. **MoreVert Icon Options Menu** ‚úÖ FIXED
**Issue**: MoreVert (three dots) menu icon was not implemented with options

**Root Cause**:
- MoreVert icon existed in ChatInterface but had no onClick handler
- No dropdown menu component was implemented

**Solution**:
- Added DropdownMenu component from shadcn/ui
- Implemented comprehensive chat options menu
- Added functional menu items with proper handlers

**Files Changed**:
- `client/src/components/storefront/ChatInterface.jsx`

**Menu Options Added**:
