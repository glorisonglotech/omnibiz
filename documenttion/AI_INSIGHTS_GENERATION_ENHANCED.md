## 🧠 5 Advanced Analyses Performed

### **1. Top Performing Products** 📊

**Analysis:**
- Counts sales for each product across all orders
- Identifies top 3 best-selling products
- Provides marketing recommendations

**Example Output:**
```
Title: "Top Performing Products"
Description: "Your best sellers are: Product A, Product B, Product C. 
             Focus marketing efforts on these products."
Confidence: 96%
Impact: High
Trend: Up
```

**Code:**
```javascript
const productSales = {};
orders.forEach(order => {
  order.items?.forEach(item => {
    const productId = item.product || item.name;
    productSales[productId] = (productSales[productId] || 0) + (item.quantity || 1);
  });
});

const topProducts = Object.entries(productSales)
  .sort((a, b) => b[1] - a[1])
  .slice(0, 3);
```

---

### **2. Revenue Velocity** 🚀

**Analysis:**
- Compares last 7 days vs previous 7 days
- Calculates acceleration/deceleration rate
- Provides momentum assessment

**Example Output:**
```
Title: "Revenue Velocity"
Description: "Revenue accelerated by 34.5% in the last 7 days. 
             Excellent momentum!"
Confidence: 93%
Impact: High (if > 15% change)
Trend: Up/Down based on direction
```

**Code:**
```javascript
const last7Days = orders.filter(o => {
  const daysAgo = (new Date() - new Date(o.date)) / (1000 * 60 * 60 * 24);
  return daysAgo <= 7;
});

const last14Days = orders.filter(o => {
  const daysAgo = (new Date() - new Date(o.date)) / (1000 * 60 * 60 * 24);
  return daysAgo > 7 && daysAgo <= 14;
});

const velocityChange = ((last7Revenue - last14Revenue) / last14Revenue * 100).toFixed(1);
```

---

### **3. Customer Retention Analysis** 👥

**Analysis:**
- Identifies repeat customers
- Calculates retention rate
- Provides loyalty assessment

**Example Output:**
```
Title: "Customer Retention Analysis"
Description: "45.2% of customers are repeat buyers (14 out of 31). 
             Strong loyalty!"
Confidence: 91%
Impact: Medium
Trend: Up (if > 25%)
```

**Code:**
```javascript
const customerOrders = {};
orders.forEach(order => {
  const email = order.customer?.email;
  if (email) {
    customerOrders[email] = (customerOrders[email] || 0) + 1;
  }
});

const repeatCustomers = Object.values(customerOrders)
  .filter(count => count > 1).length;
const totalCustomers = Object.keys(customerOrders).length;
const retentionRate = (repeatCustomers / totalCustomers) * 100;
```

**Interpretation:**
- **> 30%** → "Strong loyalty!"
- **15-30%** → "Good retention."
- **< 15%** → "Focus on loyalty programs."

---

### **4. Inventory Turnover Alert** 📦

**Analysis:**
- Identifies products with zero sales
- Calculates turnover rates
- Flags slow-moving inventory

**Example Output:**
```
Title: "Inventory Turnover Alert"
Description: "8 products have no sales activity. 
             Consider discounts or bundling to improve turnover."
Confidence: 89%
Impact: High (if > 5 products)
Trend: Warning
```

**Code:**
```javascript
const productsWithSales = products.map(p => {
  const sales = productSales[p._id] || 0;
  return {
    ...p,
    salesCount: sales,
    turnoverRate: p.stockQuantity > 0 ? sales / p.stockQuantity : 0
  };
});

const slowMovers = productsWithSales.filter(p => 
  p.salesCount === 0 && p.stockQuantity > 0
).length;
```

---

### **5. Average Order Value Trend** 💰

**Analysis:**
- Compares recent AOV vs overall average
- Identifies spending patterns
- Provides upselling recommendations

**Example Output:**
```
Title: "Average Order Value Trend"
Description: "Recent avg order value is $125.50 (+18.3% vs overall 
             avg of $106.20). Customers are spending more!"
Confidence: 90%
Impact: High (if > 15% change)
Trend: Up/Down based on direction
```

**Code:**
```javascript
const avgOrderValue = orders.length > 0
  ? orders.reduce((sum, o) => sum + (Number(o.total) || 0), 0) / orders.length
  : 0;

const recentAvg = last7Days.length > 0
  ? last7Days.reduce((sum, o) => sum + (Number(o.total) || 0), 0) / last7Days.length
  : 0;

const avgChange = ((recentAvg - avgOrderValue) / avgOrderValue * 100).toFixed(1);
```

**Interpretation:**
- **> +10%** → "Customers are spending more!"
- **< -10%** → "Consider upselling strategies."
- **±10%** → "Stable spending patterns."
