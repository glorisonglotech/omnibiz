# ✅ Profile - Real-Time Data Only!

## 🎯 What Changed

**Removed ALL hardcoded values** and now displays **ONLY real-time data** from application performance across all modules.

---

## ❌ Removed Hardcoded Values

### **Before (Hardcoded):**
```javascript
const [profileStats, setProfileStats] = useState({
  completionRate: 85, // ❌ Hardcoded
  profileViews: 1247, // ❌ Hardcoded
  connections: 89, // ❌ Hardcoded
  totalOrders: 156, // ❌ Hardcoded
  totalRevenue: 45230, // ❌ Hardcoded
  activeProjects: 8, // ❌ Hardcoded
  teamMembers: 12, // ❌ Hardcoded
  rating: 4.8, // ❌ Hardcoded
  reviewsCount: 23, // ❌ Hardcoded
});

const [activityData, setActivityData] = useState([
  { action: "Updated inventory...", timestamp: "2 hours ago" }, // ❌ Hardcoded
  { action: "Created invoice...", timestamp: "5 hours ago" }, // ❌ Hardcoded
  // ... more hardcoded data
]);
```

### **After (Real-Time Only):**
```javascript
const [profileStats, setProfileStats] = useState({
  completionRate: 0, // ✅ Will be calculated
  profileViews: 0, // ✅ Needs analytics API (zero until connected)
  connections: 0, // ✅ Will be from team API
  totalOrders: 0, // ✅ Will be from orders API
  totalRevenue: 0, // ✅ Will be calculated from orders
  activeProjects: 0, // ✅ Will be from products API
  teamMembers: 0, // ✅ Will be from team API
  rating: 0, // ✅ Will be calculated from order reviews
  reviewsCount: 0, // ✅ Will be from order reviews
  engagements: 0, // ✅ NEW: Calculated metric
  totalSales: 0, // ✅ NEW: Completed orders only
  achievements: [] // ✅ Will be calculated dynamically
});

const [activityData, setActivityData] = useState([]); // ✅ Empty until real data loads
```

   - Calculation: orders.reduce((sum, order) => sum + order.total, 0)
   - Updates: When orders change

3. Engagements
   - Source: Combined activity count
   - Calculation: orders.length + invoices.length + team.length + products.length
   - Represents: Total user activity across app

4. Completed Sales  
   - Source: Filtered orders
   - Calculation: orders.filter(o => o.status === 'completed' || o.status === 'delivered').length

   - Shows: Actual customer feedback
   - Reviews: Real count of orders with ratings

8. Profile Progress
   - Source: Calculated from profile fields
   - Checks: firstName, lastName, email, phone, bio, jobTitle, avatar, location

    timestamp: formatTimestamp(order.createdAt), // Smart formatting
    type: 'order',
    metadata: { amount: order.total } // Includes order value
  })),
  
  // Real invoices (last 2)
  ...invoices.slice(0, 2).map(invoice => ({

// Calculate average
const averageRating = reviewedOrders.length > 0 
  ? reviewedOrders.reduce((sum, o) => sum + (o.rating || 0), 0) / reviewedOrders.length 
  : 0;

// Count reviews
const reviewsCount = reviewedOrders.length;
```

**Display:**
```
