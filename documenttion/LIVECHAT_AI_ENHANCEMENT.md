## 🧠 AI Training System

### How It Works

The AI learns from every interaction:

1. **Query Storage**: Every question is stored with context
2. **Frequency Analysis**: Tracks most common questions
3. **Pattern Recognition**: Identifies similar queries
4. **Context Association**: Links queries with dashboard pages
5. **Response Rating**: Uses thumbs up/down to improve

### Training Data Stored

**localStorage Keys**:
- `aiTrainingData`: Last 100 user queries with context
- `aiQueryFrequency`: Query frequency map
- `aiSuccessfulInteractions`: Last 500 AI responses with ratings
- `aiTrainingContexts`: Last 200 context snapshots
- `aiResponseRatings`: Response quality ratings
- `ai_conversation_history`: Last 50 full conversations

### Training Statistics

View in **Settings Panel**:
- Total Conversations
- Total Interactions
- Dashboard Type
- Context Items Tracked

### Disable Training

If you prefer not to store training data:
1. Click **⚙️ Settings** in chat header
2. Toggle **AI Training** to **Disabled**

---

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### AI Not Responding

**Check**:
1. ✅ Gemini API key is set in `server/.env`
2. ✅ Server is running (shows "Gemini AI service initialized")
3. ✅ User is logged in (JWT token present)
4. ✅ Network connection is active

**Fallback**: If API fails, intelligent rule-based responses are used automatically.

### Voice Input Not Working

**Requirements**:
- Chrome, Edge, or Opera browser
- HTTPS connection (or localhost)
- Microphone permissions granted

**Fix**:
- Check browser console for errors
- Ensure microphone is not blocked
- Try refreshing the page

### Chat Widget Not Appearing

**Check**:
1. Component is imported and rendered
2. User authentication is working
3. No CSS conflicts hiding the widget
4. Z-index is high enough (z-50)

### Training Data Not Saving

**Check**:
- Training is enabled in settings
- localStorage is not full
- Browser allows localStorage

**Clear Training Data**:
```javascript
// In browser console
localStorage.removeItem('aiTrainingData');
localStorage.removeItem('aiSuccessfulInteractions');
localStorage.removeItem('aiTrainingContexts');
```

---

## 📈 Performance Optimization

### Context Refresh Interval

Currently: **30 seconds**

To adjust, edit `LiveChatWidget.jsx`:

```javascript
// Line 170
const interval = setInterval(gatherContext, 30000); // 30000ms = 30 seconds
```

Recommended: 30-60 seconds for balance between freshness and performance.

### API Call Optimization

- ✅ Conversations are batched (last 10 messages sent)
- ✅ Context data is cached and refreshed periodically
- ✅ Fallback responses reduce API calls
- ✅ Training data stored locally (no server calls)

---

## 🔐 Security & Privacy

### Data Storage

**Client-Side (localStorage)**:
- Conversation history
- Training data
- User preferences
- All data stays on user's device

**Server-Side**:
- No conversations stored permanently
- API calls are authenticated (JWT)
- Gemini AI processes requests in real-time

### API Key Security

**Best Practices**:
✅ Store in `.env` file (never commit)  
✅ Use environment variables  
✅ Add `.env` to `.gitignore`  
❌ Never hardcode in frontend  
❌ Never expose in public repos  

---

## 🎓 Example Interactions

### Admin Dashboard Examples

**Query**: "Show today's sales summary"  
**Response**: Provides total orders, revenue, pending orders with actionable insights

**Query**: "Which products need restocking?"  
**Response**: Lists low stock items with quantities and reorder suggestions

**Query**: "Analyze sales trends"  
**Response**: Offers to navigate to Analytics page with trend overview

### Storefront Examples

**Query**: "Show me popular products"  
**Response**: Guides to product catalog with filter suggestions

**Query**: "Track my order"  
**Response**: Shows order count and offers tracking assistance

**Query**: "Book an appointment"  
**Response**: Provides booking options and available services
