## ✅ **What Happens When You Make Changes**

### **Step 1: You Edit Files**
- You modify files on your computer
- Example: Edit `server/services/aiService.js`

### **Step 2: You Commit**
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "fix: Update AI service"
```
- Commit is saved **locally** on your computer
- Commit author: `devTechs001 <devtechs842@gmail.com>`

### **Step 3: You Push**
```bash
git push origin main
```
- Your commit goes **directly** to `glorisonglotech/omnibiz` on GitHub

git pull origin main
```
- Glorison (or any team member) pulls from `glorisonglotech/omnibiz`
- They get **YOUR changes** on their computer
- They see your commit with your name: `devTechs001`

## 🚫 **What You DON'T Have**

### **You DON'T Have a Fork**

Some people work with forks, but **that's NOT your setup**:

```
❌ NOT YOUR SETUP:

glorisonglotech/omnibiz (Original)
         ↓ (fork)
devtechs842/omnibiz (Your personal fork)
         ↕️
Your Computer
```

**Why this is NOT your setup**:
- Your remote is `glorisonglotech/omnibiz`, not `devtechs842/omnibiz`
- You push directly to the team repository
- You don't have a personal copy on GitHub

---

## ✅ **What You DO Have**

### **Direct Collaboration**

```
✅ YOUR ACTUAL SETUP:

glorisonglotech/omnibiz (Team Repository)
         ↕️
Your Computer

- You are a collaborator
- You push directly to the team repo
- No intermediate fork
- Changes are immediate
```

## 🎯 **Answering Your Question**

### **"So changes will also apply to my repo??"**

**Answer**: There is NO separate "your repo"!

3. ✅ Changes appear on GitHub immediately
4. ✅ Everyone on the team can pull and see your changes

- There's no separate "your copy" - it's the team's document
- Same with Git: you're all working on the team's repository

---

## 🔧 **How to Check What's on GitHub**

### **Method 1: Visit GitHub**
1. Go to https://github.com/glorisonglotech/omnibiz
2. You'll see all commits, including yours
3. Click "Commits" to see full history

git fetch origin
git diff main origin/main
```
If output is empty, your local copy matches GitHub exactly

## 🚀 **Best Practices**

### **1. Pull Before You Push**
```bash
git pull origin main
# Make your changes
git add .
git commit -m "Your message"
git push origin main
```
**Why**: Get latest team changes before pushing yours

### **2. Communicate with Team**
- Let team know about major changes
- Use descriptive commit messages
- Create branches for big features

### **3. Check Status Regularly**
```bash
git status
git log origin/main --oneline -5
```
**Why**: Stay aware of what's on GitHub vs your computer
