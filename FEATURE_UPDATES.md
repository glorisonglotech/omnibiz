# Feature Updates - User-Specific Data & Navigation

## Overview
This document summarizes the three key features implemented:
1. **Team Management** - User-specific team member filtering
2. **Store Overview** - Product catalog page with navigation link
3. **Search Feature** - Fully integrated search functionality

---

## 1. Team Management - User-Specific Filtering

### Problem
Team members were being fetched globally without filtering by the authenticated user, allowing users to see other users' team members.

### Solution
Updated the backend team controller to filter all team operations by the current authenticated user.

### Changes Made

#### Backend: `server/controllers/teamController.js`
- **Modified `getAllTeamMembers()`**: Now filters team members by `userId: req.user._id`
- **Modified `getTeamMemberById()`**: Validates ownership before returning team member
- **Modified `updateTeamMember()`**: Only allows updates to owned team members
- **Modified `deleteTeamMember()`**: Only allows deletion of owned team members

```javascript
// Before
const teamMembers = await TeamMember.find().populate("userId");

// After
const teamMembers = await TeamMember.find({ userId: req.user._id }).populate("userId");
```

### Benefits
-  Each user sees only their own team members
-  Prevents unauthorized access to other users' data
-  Improved data security and privacy
-  Better user experience with personalized data

### Testing
1. Log in as User A and add team members
2. Log in as User B and add different team members
3. Verify each user only sees their own team members
4. Attempt to edit/delete other users' team members (should fail)

## 2. Store Overview Button & Product Page

### Problem
- No clear navigation from E-Commerce dashboard to view all products
- Store.jsx file was empty with just comments

### Solution
Implemented a full-featured Store page and added navigation button in E-Commerce dashboard.

### Changes Made

#### Frontend: `client/src/pages/Store.jsx`
Created a complete product store page with:
- **Product Display**: Grid and list view modes
- **Search & Filter**: Real-time product search and category filtering
- **Statistics**: Total products, inventory value, categories, low stock alerts
- **Product Cards**: Image, price, stock status, category
- **API Integration**: Fetches products from `/products` endpoint
- **Fallback Data**: Mock products if API fails
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-friendly layout

Features:
```javascript
- Search by name or description
- Filter by category
- Toggle between grid/list view
- Stock status indicators (In Stock, Low Stock, Out of Stock)
- Back navigation button
- Loading states


#### Frontend: `client/src/pages/dashboard/ECommerce.jsx`
Added "Store Overview" button:
javascript
<Button
  variant="default"
  className="gap-2 bg-blue-600 hover:bg-blue-700"
  onClick={() => window.location.href = '/store'}
>
  <Package className="h-4 w-4" />
  Store Overview
</Button>


#### Frontend: `client/src/App.jsx`
Added Store route:
javascript
<Route path="store" element={<Store />} />
```

### Benefits
-  Easy access to product catalog from E-Commerce dashboard
-  Comprehensive product overview with search/filter capabilities
-  oth grid and list view options
-  Stock management visibility
-  Professional UI with proper error handling

### Navigation Flow
```
E-Commerce Dashboard → "Store Overview" Button → Store Page
                                                   ↓
                                      View all products with:
                                      - Search capability
                                      - Category filters
                                      - Stock status                                   - Pricing info
