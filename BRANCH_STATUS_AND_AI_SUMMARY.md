## üé® Client Storefront Theme Issues

### Current Theme System (on main branch)

The storefront uses **ThemeSelector** component with multiple themes:

**Available Themes** (from `AVAILABLE_THEMES`):
- Default
- Dark
- Blue
- Green
- Purple
- Orange
- Pink
- Custom business themes

### Common Theme Issues & Solutions

#### Issue 1: Theme Not Persisting
**Cause**: Theme not saved to localStorage or database
**Solution**: Check `ThemeContext` and ensure theme is saved:
```javascript
localStorage.setItem('selectedTheme', themeName);
```

#### Issue 2: Colors Not Matching Business Brand
**Cause**: Using default theme instead of business-specific theme
**Solution**: Set business theme in user settings or ThemeSelector

#### Issue 3: Dark Mode Not Working
**Cause**: CSS variables not properly defined
**Solution**: Check `index.css` for `.dark` class definitions

#### Issue 4: Storefront Looks Different from Admin Dashboard
**Cause**: This is **intentional** - storefront should look customer-friendly, not admin-like
**Solution**: Customize storefront theme separately from admin theme

## üîß How AI Determines User Type

The AI controller checks in this order:

```javascript
const isCustomer = req.customer !== undefined && req.customer !== null;
const isAdmin = req.user !== undefined && req.user !== null && !isCustomer;
const isGuest = !isAdmin && !isCustomer;
```

**Authentication Headers**:
- **Admin/Business Owner**: `Authorization: Bearer <businessToken>`
- **Customer**: `Authorization: Bearer <customerToken>`
- **Guest**: No authorization header

**Dashboard Type Parameter**:
```javascript
// In API request
{
  "message": "What are my orders?",
  "dashboardType": "storefront" // or "admin"
}
```

---

## ‚úÖ Verification Checklist

To ensure AI responses vary correctly:

- [ ] Check `dashboardType` is sent in API request
- [ ] Verify correct token is used (customer vs business)
- [ ] Test as guest (no token)
- [ ] Test as registered customer (customerToken)
- [ ] Test as business owner (businessToken)
- [ ] Check AI response tone and content differ
- [ ] Verify theme applies correctly on storefront
