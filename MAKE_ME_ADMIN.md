## 👑 Become System Owner (Full Privileges)

### **Option 1: Make Existing User Admin** (Fastest)

If you already have an account:

```bash
cd server
node scripts/makeAdmin.js your@email.com
```

**Example:**
```bash
node scripts/makeAdmin.js melanie@omnibiz.com
```

This will:
- ✅ Find your user account
- ✅ Upgrade role to "owner"
- ✅ Grant ALL permissions
- ✅ Activate account
- ✅ Verify email

---

### **Option 2: Create New Super Admin**

If you need a new admin account:

```bash
cd server
node scripts/createAdmin.js
```

Follow the prompts:
```
Name: Melanie
Email: melanie@omnibiz.com
Password: ********
```

---

### **Option 3: Direct Database Update** (Manual)

If scripts don't work, update directly in MongoDB:

1. Open MongoDB Compass or mongosh
2. Connect to your database
3. Find your user in the `users` collection
4. Update the document:

```json
{
  "role": "owner",
  "permissions": [
    "all",
    "manage_users",
    "manage_products",
    "manage_orders",
    "manage_services",
    "manage_appointments",
    "manage_finances",
    "manage_team",
    "manage_locations",
    "manage_settings",
    "view_analytics",
    "manage_discounts",
    "manage_feedback",
    "manage_support",
    "delete_any",
    "edit_any"
  ],
  "isActive": true,
  "isEmailVerified": true
}
```
