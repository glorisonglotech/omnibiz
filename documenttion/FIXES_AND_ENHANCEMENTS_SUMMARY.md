## 🐛 Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ **seedData.js Database Connection Error** 
**Error**: `The 'uri' parameter to 'openUri()' must be a string, got "undefined"`

**Root Cause**: The `dotenv.config()` was not loading the `.env` file from the correct path when running scripts from the `scripts/` directory.

**Fix Applied**:
- Updated `omnibiz/server/scripts/seedData.js` to explicitly load `.env` from parent directory
- Added `path` module and configured dotenv with correct path

**Code Change**:
```javascript
// Before
dotenv.config();

// After
const path = require('path');
dotenv.config({ path: path.join(__dirname, '..', '.env') });
```

**File Modified**: `omnibiz/server/scripts/seedData.js`

### 2. ✅ **Dashboard 404 Error for /api/customers**
**Error**: `GET http://localhost:5000/api/customers 404 (Not Found)`

**Root Cause**: The main business dashboard was trying to fetch `/api/customers` endpoint, but this route is designed for customer storefront authentication, not for business owners to get their customer list.

**Fix Applied**:
- Updated `omnibiz/client/src/pages/Dashboard.jsx` to use the correct endpoint
- Changed from `/api/customers` to `/api/messages/customers`
- This endpoint returns customers invited by the business owner

**Code Change**:
```javascript
// Before
api.get('/customers', { headers })

// After
api.get('/messages/customers', { headers }) // Fixed: Use correct endpoint for business owner's customers
```

**File Modified**: `omnibiz/client/src/pages/Dashboard.jsx` (line 45)

### 3. ✅ **Storefront Bookings Display in Main Dashboard**
**Status**: Already Working Correctly ✅

**Verification**:
- Storefront bookings created via `/api/public/appointments` are automatically linked to business owner via `userId` field
- The `getAllAppointments` controller filters appointments by `userId: req.user._id`
- All appointments (including storefront bookings) are automatically displayed in the main dashboard

**How It Works**:
1. Customer books service on storefront → `/api/public/appointments`
2. Appointment is created with `userId: businessOwnerId` (from invite code)
3. Business owner views dashboard → `/api/appointments` fetches all appointments where `userId` matches
4. Storefront bookings appear alongside manually created appointments

**Files Involved**:
- `omnibiz/server/controllers/AppointmentController.js` (line 8-87: createPublicAppointment)
- `omnibiz/server/controllers/AppointmentController.js` (line 134-160: getAllAppointments)
- `omnibiz/server/routes/publicRoutes.js` (line 175-244: public appointment route)

  <div className="mb-6 animate-in fade-in slide-in-from-top-4 duration-500">
